On the site, you can:
- make an account, login to existing account, 
- or you can login with facebook or google,
- make posts (they can contain either text or picture or both),

- you can also use search menu, to search for posts with specific titles.

All the gems present are inside the GemFile, and all you need to do is run bundle install, rake db:create and than rake db:migrate.
